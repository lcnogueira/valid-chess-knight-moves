## The Challenge
Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered game board with 64 squares/cells arranged in an 8x8 grid. Algebraic notation in chess is a method to map cells using A to H as columns (left to right) and 1 to 8 as rows (bottom to top).

In a chess game there are many different pieces. **In this test we will be using the piece called
Knight**. A knight can move either 2 squares horizontally and 1 square vertically OR 2 squares vertically
and 1 square horizontally.

## Requirements

- The user should be able to click/tap a button. The cell should be highlighted and have the app highlight all cells where the Knight can move in exactly 2 turns.
- Only one cell should be selected at a time.
- The app should make an API call to get the cells it has to highlight and the logic to calculate possible positions should be in the backend.
- The Knight position should be sent to the API in Algebraic notation (D4, A5, H8, A1, ...). If the position is not in Algebraic notation, the backend should return an error.
- There should be an introduction page in a form of a steps wizard that illustrates how the app works and what to expect.
- The wizard page should be responsive and work on all devices and written in clear English that a non-technical client would be able to understand.
