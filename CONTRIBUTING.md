# Contributing to `valid-chess-knight-moves`

As the creators and maintainers of this project, we want to ensure that the project lives and continues to grow and evolve. The evolution of the project should never be blocked by any single person's time. One of the simplest ways of doing this is by encouraging a larger set of shallow contributors. Through this, we hope to mitigate the problems of a project that needs updates but there's no-one who has the power to do so.

### How do I set up the project?

First of all, make sure you have [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. After that, run [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) in the root of the project to install the dependencies. Edit the code in the `src` folder and run the project in `develop` mode (use `yarn run dev`) to see the changes on `http://localhost:3000` as you code. It's luckily very simple! :wink:

### Quick Guide to Contributing

Here is a quick guide to doing code contributions to the project.

1. Find some issue you're interested in, or a feature that you'd like to tackle. Also make sure that no one else is already working on it. We don't want you to be disappointed.

2. Discuss the change you wish to make via issue with the owners of this repository before making a change.

2. Fork, then clone: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/valid-chess-knight-moves.git`

3. Create a branch with a meaningful name for the issue: `git checkout -b fix-something`

4. Install packages by running `yarn` in the root of the project.

5. Make your changes and commit: `git add` and `git commit`

    *Remember that we have a pre-commit hook that runs tests and lints the code to prevent mistakes.*

6. Make sure that the tests still pass: `yarn test` and `yarn run lint` (for the lint checks)

7. Push your branch: `git push -u origin your-branch-name`

8. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.

9. Choose a descriptive title and describe your changes briefly.

10. Wait for a maintainer to review your PR, make changes if it's being recommended, and get it merged.

11. Celebrate! :tada:
